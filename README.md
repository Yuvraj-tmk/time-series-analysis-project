determine their effectiveness in predicting future stock prices. The project provides practical exposure to real-world financial data and develops skills in data preprocessing, statistical modelling, deep learning, and result visualization. Through a comparative analysis of model performance, the project concludes with insights into which approaches work best under specific conditions, making it an enriching experience for anyone aiming to understand financial forecasting. This project, titled “Time Series Analysis and Forecasting for Stock Market”, aims to explore and implement various forecasting techniques to predict stock price movements based on historical data. The unpredictable nature of the stock market makes forecasting a valuable yet challenging task. By leveraging time series modelling techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Facebook Prophet, and LSTM, the project attempts to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in financial time series data. These models are applied and evaluated to
